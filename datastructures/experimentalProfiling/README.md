# Experimental Profiling of Heap Implementations
To run the lab:
* Make sure you are ssh'ed into the cycle servers to properly use timing

(1) Command Line: ./Lab09

(2) Select Menu Choice 1: Test Performance

(3) Insert the size of hash table (m-value) to be 1,000,000

The test on my machine takes around 12 minutes just as a heads up.
Most of the time takes from deleteMax on Min 5 and deleteMin on Max 5 Heap

If you want to see the results on a smaller scale I would recommend testing on size 200,000 or 300,000 because it still shows important results.
